                        </a>
                        <p>
                            The Purpose of building this projects is very simple which is to make Prescription and Reports a digital copy
                            In this every single person on this earth will be given a patient-id through this he/she can show his/her Reports.
                            Similarly, Every Doctor will also be given a Doctor-id in which he/she can see the details of patients. And also Prescribe
                            the medicines and patients can buy their meds through this App.  
                        </p>

                        <h3>Smart WheelChair</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have seen the electric powered wheelchair. However, this technology has basic drawbacks since the disable person still are not able to reach WheelChair if it was far placed from them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Objective of this research is to create a system that helps the disabled person to locate their WheelChair's position and to move it via Android application to desired destination.
